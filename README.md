# Unknown Beings (Origins)
A datapack that adds the Gatekeeper, Scattered Ones, and Warper origins. 
<br/>
<br/>

## Origins:
<ul>
<details>
<summary>
<b>Gatekeeper</b>
</summary>
The gatekeepers are mystical beings created by the universe to correct the timeline.
<br>
<br>
<b>Powers:</b>

```diff
+ Transdimensional Gateway
At a cost of 5 hearts, 16 ender pearls in your offhand, and a block in your mainhand, you summon a temporary cloud of particles that will teleport anyone who enters into the dimension the held block belongs to.


+ Celestial Adaptation
In The End, you have slow falling. And in The Nether, you have fire resistance, while in the Overworld, you have resistance.


+ Peak Physical Specimen
You were made by existence itself, made to kill Warpers and those who mess with the timeline. You have strength 1, jump boost 2, and do 3 extra damage to Timeshifters, Warpers, and Enderians. (if the respective datapacks are installed)


! Transdimensional Instability
All of your interdimensional travel has made your very being unstable. When you die, you explode, hurting all nearby entities and making your items cease to exist.


- Galactic Favoritism
Due to your creators making you in order to correct the timeline, time affects you much less sparingly than it affects others. Your hunger declines faster, and your natural regeneration is slower.


- Weak to Arcane Arts
Your celestial body is much easier to damage with any sort of enchanted weaponry, not only doing extra damage to you, but also ignoring your armor.

<summary>
<b>Scattered One</b>
</summary>
The Scattered Ones are beings of unknown origin. They are a cloud of purple particles, their very atoms in cluster, acting as pocket realms where they store their items.
<br>
<br>
<b>Powers:</b>

```diff
+ Particle Condensing
By pressing the primary ability key, you can pull your particles together to form a solid being. This will disable all of your buffs, and most of your weaknesses, making you mostly human.


+ Lightweight
While in your Scattered form, you move faster, jump higher, and fall slower.


+ Suffocation
If you press your secondary ability key while in your Scattered form, your cloud grows in size temporarily, anything within this expanded cloud is poisoned.


+ Knowledge of the Dark Arts
Your mysterious knowledge of the dark arts makes all cursed items much more efficient to you.


! Scattered Form
Your default form is just a small cloud of purple particles.


- Void Dissolution
When in The End or high altitudes for too long, you will begin to wither away as your cells struggle to stay within their cloud.


- Physical Instability
Your solid form will eventually begin to decay and wither, as your cells cannot hold themselves together for too long.


- Unknown Upbringing
Your curiosity about your past makes it impossible for you to sleep

<summary>
<b>Warper</b>
</summary>
Warpers are an alien race that have evolved over the millenia to displace their particles and reform them in another location.
<br>
<br>
<b>Powers:</b>

```diff
+ Particle Relocation
Upon pressing the primary ability key, you poof into a cloud of purple particles and reappear where you were looking.
This fills a quarter of your displacement bar.


+ Particle Acceleration
Upon pressing the secondary ability key, your particles become a cloud of purple and you dash forward, hurting everything in your path.
This fills an eighth of your displacement bar.


+ Transdimensional Relocation
If you press the primary ability key while holding a block, you teleport to the respective dimension of the block, relative to your position.
This ability temporarily gives you resistance and slow falling to avoid the dangers of relocating.
This fills half of your displacement bar


! Mysterious Evolution
Your skin is tinted blue-ish purple.


- Displacement
If your displacement bar is full, you will begin to wither as your particles mistakenly displace themselves.
The bar will naturally go down over time.


- Tradeoff
Transdimensional Relocation will consume 5 hearts


- Photosensitive Particles
Your particles will set on fire if you teleport while in (or into) sunlight.
